# Contributing to Aviator

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Aviator! It's people like you that make Aviator such a great game.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/your-repo/aviator/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork Aviator](https://github.com/your-repo/aviator/fork) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #38 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
feature/38-add-leaderboard
```

### Get the test suite running

Make sure you're able to run the tests. We only accept pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate: `npm test`

### Did you find a bug?

*   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/aviator/issues).

*   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/your-repo/aviator/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Write a good commit message

Write a great commit message! A good commit message should be descriptive and concise. It should explain the "what" and "why" of the change, not the "how".

## Submitting a pull request

When you're done making changes, open a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill out the required template. This will help us review your PR. This template will be automatically added to your PR, so you don't have to worry about finding it.
- Don't forget to link the PR to the issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork and push them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge conflicts, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/github/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down your pull requests into smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It's also a good idea to open the PR and mark it as a draft so that the team can review it as you go.

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in any amount. If you want to contribute financially, please visit our [Open Collective page](https-opencollective-com-aviator).
